# Rainforest Eagle 100

This driver is for the original Eagle (4 lights)

## Notes

- Disable (uncheck) `Remote Management` and `Security` (Settings > Eagle > Cog)
- Use the MAC address printed on the bottom of device preceded by a `0x`: 
    - `0xADDRESS_ON_BOTTOM`
- The Eagle will likely locked up after a period of time so it is recommended you plug it into a smart outlet. The app can automatically power cycle the outlet when it detects that the Eagle is not responding.
